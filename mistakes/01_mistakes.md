## Trial and Error is the only method of learning

* Think: evolution

!SLIDE bullets incremental

* But evolution is random, how is that helpful!
* Is it?

!SLIDE bullets incremental

* Step one: try something!
* Step two: Does it work?
 * Yes! Do it again!
 * No! Try something else!
* Step three: Feedback!

## Feedback ###

###  Warning! Massive oversimplifications below! ###

* Feedback is scary, but we need it.
* When you are fist starting out, you think at the details level
 * Useful metaunderstanding of what you are doing is very difficult!
 * Only time and experience will improve that
 * In the meantime: listen to what people who have that think!

## Three things to remember: ##

* Don't let fear of being wrong stop you from getting started!
* Listen to what people with more experience have to say!
* Don't let fear of being wrong stop you from ignoring their advice!

!SLIDE bullets incremental left

* People with more experience have a deeper understanding of the subject you're learning
 * But _knowing a lot_ and _being right_ are NOT the same thing.
 * Eventually you have to do things the wrong way to know why they're wrong

!SLIDE bullets incremental style=left

* A teacher is a guide.
 * You must learn on your own
 * Other people can only help direct you

!SLIDE bullets incremental

* Remember to pick the appropriate setting for experimentation
 * Client projects? ...Probably not.
 * Personal projects? Definitely!

!SLIDE bullets incremental

* Your personal projects should be full of mistakes!
* They are your sandbox for getting a deep understanding
* But they are also a place to rehearse.

# Repitition and Meditation #

!SLIDE bullets incremental

* When you have figured something out, repeat it
 * Everything looking like a nail is not a bad thing!

!SLIDE bullets incremental

* Push your new tool to its limit to learn what that is
 * Then meditate on it.
 * Understand why the limit is what it is.
* Adjust and repeat!
